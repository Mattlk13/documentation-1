For communication between your CodeShip project and outside via SSH, you will need your project's SSH public key which you can find in your project settings. This key is also automatically added to your source control provider so CodeShip can clone your repository for builds.

* Select a project and then click _Project Settings_ in the upper right corner
* Then click _General_ in the upper right corner
* View the SSH key in the _Keys_ section in the upper right corner

If you need more information on how to use SSH and similar tools, see [Deployment via FTP, SFTP, SCP, RSYNC, and SSH]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-ftp-sftp-scp.md %}).

## Reset the SSH Key

If you need to reset the SSH key pair for the project you can use the _Reset SSH Key_ button. This will generate a new SSH key pair and also add the new key to your source control provider.

## Use Case Examples

* You are deploying to one of your own servers instead of using CodeShip's integrations to services like AWS and Heroku.

* Your deployment script has a few more commands you want to be executed and you want to deploy to another service directly.

* You are using SSH tunnels to connect to your database within your tests.
